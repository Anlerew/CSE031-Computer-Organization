TPS Activity 1:
1. A function returns a value, but a procedure does not. A method is similar to a function, but is internal part of a class.
2. N/A
3. N/A
4. Line 20, adds the 2 values together
5. No because we aren't jumping labels, we are jumping registers.
6. At line 11. It saves in register $v0. The value is 15. It does make sense.
7. It doesn't work.
8. 0x00400020
9. It is correct. It resulted in the number 15.
10. The new return address is 0x00400028
11. We should use jal
12. N/A

TPS Activity 2:
1. The output is 38.
2. The main functions loads the integers x and y and calls the sum.
3. The SUM knows where to return to because the address is linked to it using the jal operator. The SUM changes addresses for the SUM into SUB.
4. This problem can be solved by saving the value of SUM in a non temporary register and having SUB saved in a temporary register so it can be saved later in a non tempory register.
5. It goes to line 15. Yes it is because you are getting rid of the value of x so you must give it to another register
6. N/A
