TPS Activity 1:
1. 2
2. 41414141
3. Yes the answer is 41414141
4. 2 No because we changed four_ints[0] t0 41414141 to a char pointer
5. a. Only one array is allocated
   b. Yes. The array name is pointing to the base address of the array. So both four_c and four_ints points to same location.
   c. 2

6. Difference of 4 bytes in int
7. N/A
8. Difference of 1 byte in char
9. N/A
10. It reads the entirety of the block of memory as int 4 bytes and char 1 byte, etc.
11. N/A
12. N/A

TPS Activity 2:
1. It will allocate the memory for int** with its condition of being as big as n time int*
2. We can think of arr as a pointer to a pointer to an integer. That is int**.
3. N/A
4. You need to pass the size because the memory is not automatically allocated so you have to manually allocate the memory yourself with malloc.
5. N/A
6. N/A
7. N/A
8. N/A
